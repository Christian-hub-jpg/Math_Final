  abstract  = {In Chapters 2 and 3, we saw that first-order differential equations can be used to model a variety of physical situations. However, many physical situations need to be modeled by higher order differential equations. For example, in 1735, Daniel Bernoulli’s (1700-1782) study of the vibration of an elastic beam led to the fourth-order differential equation k4d4ydx4=y, which describes the displacement of the simple modes. This equation can be rewritten in the form y−k4d4ydx4=0. Both Bernoulli and Euler realized that a solution to the equation is y = ex/k but that other solutions to the equation must also exist (see Exercise 71 in Chapter 4 Review Exercises).}

  abstract = {We investigate some properties of approximate solutions for the second-order inhomogeneous linear differential equations, y′′(x)+αy′(x)+βy(x)=r(x), with complex constant coefficients. And, as an application of our results, we will see the time independent Schrödinger equations. This paper was motivated by the paper, Li and Shen (2010).}
